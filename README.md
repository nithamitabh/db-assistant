Welcome to the SQL Query Agent! This application allows you to interact with an SQLite database using plain English questions. Powered by GroqCloud, Llama3, and Langchain, it translates your questions into SQL queries, executes them, and presents the results in a user-friendly manner. Perfect for non-technical analysts to get insights from the database without needing SQL knowledge.

## Features ‚ú®

- üîç **Natural Language Processing**: Converts plain English questions into SQL queries.
- ‚ö° **Real-time Query Execution**: Executes SQL queries on the fly and retrieves data.
- üß† **ReAct Prompting**: Utilizes reasoning and acting logic for better query handling.
- üí¨ **Plain English Results**: Presents the results of the queries in an easy-to-understand format.
- üîí **Environment Variables**: Securely manages API keys and sensitive information using `.env` files.
